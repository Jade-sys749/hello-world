# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
For privacy's sake, I will introduce myself as JM. I am learning to code and very optimistic as well as excited to do so. Coming from a technology background, I believe this is the next step to take moving towards my goals both personally and professionally. Some activities that I enjoy outside of my faith, family first and working are dancing, exploring both classic and new music and learning new things. Quite the adventurer, traveling is also vital to my life as well. I look forward to this journey I am beginning and to collaborating via GitHub. Thank you for checking out my bio. :-)
